## Before You Start

### What You'll Need
- **Node.js** (v16 or higher) - [Download here](https://nodejs.org/)
- **Git** - [Download here](https://git-scm.com/)
- **A code editor** - We recommend [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- **A Chromium browser** (Chrome, Edge, Brave) for testing (recommended, however you can use firefox although it requires being built every time you make a change)

### Helpful Background (but not required!)
- Basic JavaScript/TypeScript knowledge
- Some familiarity with HTML/CSS
- Understanding of browser extensions (we'll teach you!)

**Don't worry if you're missing some of these!** We're happy to help you learn. ü§ó

## Your First 30 Minutes

Let's get you up and running quickly:

### 1. Get the Code (3 minutes)
```bash
# Fork the repository on GitHub first, then:
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/BetterSEQTA-plus.git
cd BetterSEQTA-plus
```

### 2. Install Dependencies (3 minutes)
```bash
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

### 3. Start Development Server (2 minutes)
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 4. Load Extension in Browser (4 minutes)
1. Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions`
2. Enable "Developer mode" (toggle in top right)
3. Click "Load unpacked"
4. Select the `dist` folder in your project
5. Visit a SEQTA Learn page to see BetterSEQTA+ in action!

### 5. Make a Tiny Change (5 minutes)
Let's prove everything works:
1. Open `src/SEQTA.ts`
2. Find the line that says `"[BetterSEQTA+] Successfully initialised"`
3. Change it to `"[BetterSEQTA+] Successfully initialised - Hello [YOUR_NAME]!"`
4. Save the file
5. Go to `chrome://extensions`, click the refresh icon on BetterSEQTA+
6. Refresh a SEQTA page and check the browser console (F12) - you should see your message!

### 6. Reset Your Change (3 minutes)
```bash
git checkout -- src/SEQTA.ts
```

**Congratulations! üéâ You've successfully set up BetterSEQTA+ for development!**

## Common Questions

**Q: I'm new to browser extensions. Is this too advanced for me?**
A: Not at all! We have lots of beginner-friendly issues, and our plugin system makes it easy to add features without understanding all the browser extension complexities.

**Q: How long does it take to get my first PR merged?**
A: For simple fixes, usually 1-3 days. For larger features, it might take a week or two as we discuss the best approach.

**Q: I made a mistake in my PR. What do I do?**
A: No worries! Just push more commits to the same branch and they'll be added to your PR automatically.

**Q: Can I work on multiple issues at once?**
A: It's better to focus on one issue at a time, especially when starting out. This makes code review easier and reduces conflicts.

**Q: What if I start working on something and get stuck?**
A: Ask for help! Create a draft PR with what you have so far, and we'll help you figure out the next steps.
