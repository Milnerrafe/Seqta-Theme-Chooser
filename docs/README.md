## Core Concepts

BetterSEQTA+ is built around several core concepts:

1. **Plugin System**: BetterSEQTA+ uses a plugin system to extend SEQTA with new features. Plugins are self-contained pieces of code that can be enabled or disabled by the user. Check out our [plugin guide](./plugins/README.md) to learn how to create your own!

2. **Type-Safe Settings**: Each plugin can define settings that are type-safe and automatically rendered in the settings UI. The settings system uses TypeScript decorators to make it easy to define settings with proper typing.

3. **Storage API**: Plugins can use the Storage API to persist data between sessions. The Storage API is also type-safe, ensuring that plugins can only access their own data.

4. **SEQTA Integration**: BetterSEQTA+ integrates with SEQTA Learn by injecting code into the page. This allows plugins to modify the SEQTA UI and add new features.
